This assignment Completed in three segment
1. Navbar
2. Registration Form 
3. Dash Board


In the Navbar I create a Sign Up option when the user click on the Sign in option so the user directly go to the Registration component of the project then then they have to fill all the information which will be required for the registration and if they not fill the information the pop up will come for to do the same for the complition and after clicking on the registration button it will redirect to the dashboard component of the project.
